# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my NixOS installations across three computers. I use it primarily to sync declarative settings between three different computers and to track version history.


## Installation

- Install the standard GNOME version of NixOS, nothing particularly needed here besides setting username to `mvhove`.
- Open a terminal and run `./home/mvhove/.dotfiles/install.sh`
- Follow the instructions carefully

## Maintaining

- Open a terminal and run `./home/mvhove/.dotfiles/update.sh`
